# Extension overrides for ambiguous Linguist mappings.
#
# When multiple languages share an extension, Linguist uses heuristics and
# a Bayesian classifier on file content to disambiguate. We don't have file
# content (only filenames from commit details), so we pick the most popular
# language for each conflicting extension.
#
# Format: extension (without dot, lowercase) = "Language Name"
# The language must exist in languages.yml; its type is looked up automatically.
#
# To update: add/remove entries as community usage shifts.
